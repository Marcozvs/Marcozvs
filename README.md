## About Me

I am a front-end developer with three years of experience and currently in the eighth semester of my Computer Engineering degree at Universidade São Judas Tadeu. I have hands-on experience in software development, working on the creation of efficient and intuitive interfaces aligned with best practices in usability and performance.

At Maida.health, I contributed to the development of the iHealth healthcare management platform and the telemedicine solution. Later, at POST, I worked on the front-end development of a public offering management platform, being responsible for implementing the system’s interfaces and user flows.

I have experience in front-end development, with extensive knowledge of both the Angular and React ecosystems. Among the technologies in these environments, I highlight RxJS and NgRx in Angular, and Redux and Next.js in React. Additionally, I have knowledge of back-end development using the Spring ecosystem, as well as a solid foundation in software architecture, database modeling, and UML for system analysis and documentation.
